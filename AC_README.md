<h1>Flashcards</h1>
<h3>By Ann Cerveny</h3>

<p>Flashcards is the first project of Mod 2 in the Front-End Engineering 1903 cohort at the Turing School of Software and Design. It is a JavaScript-based program that uses the command-line as an interface to review a dataset of prototype questions. The focus of this project was to familiarize students with ES6 classes, SRP methodology, and develop TDD skills. A personal focus was to ensure that I was grasping the interactivity between classes, organize a testing quite with significant coverage, and finish the project with clean, concise code.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>Clone down the repo using the following command:</p>

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

<p>Once the repo has been cloned, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:</p>

```bash
npm install
```

<p>Running `node index.js` from the root of the cloned project should begin the game.</p>
